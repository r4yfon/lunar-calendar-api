> *An API that converts between Gregorian and Lunar calendar systems, serving cultural and religious applications worldwide*

The Lunar Calendar API is built using the astronomical formulae from *Astronomical Algorithms* by Jean Meeus, 1998 and Ho Ngoc Duc's Lunar calendar calculator.

## ⚠️ Demo API Update

> **The public demo endpoint (`lunar-calendar-api.netlify.app`) has been sunset due to excessive traffic.**

**First, a huge thank you.** I built this project to learn, and I am incredibly grateful that so many of you have found it useful. The response has been amazing—to the point where the demo was handling **over 6,000 requests every day**!

As I work full-time, I cannot maintain a paid infrastructure for a free demo.

**The Good News: You can own it!**
You can deploy your own private, unlimited instance of this API for free in less than 2 minutes.

1.  **Click the button below** to deploy this to your own Netlify account.
2.  You will get a new URL (e.g., `https://your-name-lunar-api.netlify.app`) to use in your apps.

*Thank you for understanding and for supporting open source!*

## Why This API?

Lunar calendars guide over one billion people's cultural and religious practices. From China's Spring Festival to Vietnam's *Tet*, accurate Lunar dates are essential for cultural applications, but most software libraries lack proper Lunar calendar support.

## Quick Start

<!--
Convert September 2nd, 2025 (in Gregorian calendar) to Lunar calendar in time zone +08:00:

```bash
curl "https://lunar-calendar-api.netlify.app/v0/2/g2l?y=2025&m=9&d=2&z=8"
```
-->

Run the server locally (see below), then convert September 2nd, 2025 (Gregorian) to Lunar calendar in time zone +08:00:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/v0/2/g2l?y=2025&m=9&d=2&z=8"
```

## Usage

There are two ways to run the API server: **locally** or **using Docker**.

### Local Server

To install dependencies and build:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

To start the API server at <http://localhost:3000>:

```bash
npm run start
```

To run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

**Optional:** Create `.env` file at the root to specify a different port:
```dotenv
PORT=3000
```

### Docker

```bash
# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t lunar-calendar-api .
docker run -p 3000:3000 lunar-calendar-api

# Run tests in Docker
docker build --target tester .
```

## Features

**📅 Bidirectional Conversion** - Gregorian ↔ Lunar calendar with full metadata

**🪐 Astronomical Accuracy** - Based on Jean Meeus's algorithms

**🌝 Leap Month Support** - Handles complex lunar leap month calculations

**🌐 Timezone Aware** - Precise conversions across all global timezones

**📜 Extended Date Range** - Supports calculations for historical dates (note: accuracy decreases for very ancient dates due to astronomical uncertainties)

**🌏 Multilingual Output** - English, Vietnamese, Traditional/Simplified Chinese

## API

### Convert Gregorian date to Lunar calendar

```http
GET /v0/2/g2l
```

Parameters:

* `y`: Gregorian year. For example, AD 1 is 1, AD 2024 is 2024, 1 BC is 0, 10 BC is -9.
* `m`: Gregorian month, from 1 to 12.
* `d`: Gregorian day of month, from 1 to 31.
* `z`: Time zone offset in hours. For example +09:00 is 9, -10:00 is -10, 00:00 is 0.
* `lang` or `language` *(optional)*: Language of textual representation of the Lunar date, must be one of "en" (English, i.e. modern representation), "vi" (Vietnamese), "zh" (Traditional Chinese), and "zh-cn" (Simplified Chinese). If not specified, a "modern representation" would be provided. `lang` and `language` are equivalent.

Return: JSON object of the equivalent date in Lunar calendar.

**Example 1:** To convert the Gregorian date July 19th, 2024 in time zone +07:00 to Lunar calendar:

```http
GET /v0/2/g2l?y=2024&m=7&d=19&z=7
```

This should send:

```json
{
  "date": {
    "year": 2024,
    "month": 6,
    "monthSize": 29,
    "leap": false,
    "day": 14
  },
  "text": "2024.06s.14"
}
```

which means July 19th, 2024 is the day 14, month 6 in Lunar calendar (approximately in AD 2024).

**Example 2:** To convert the Gregorian date August 11th, 2025 in time zone +07:00 to Lunar calendar and also get the textual representation in Traditional Chinese:

```http
GET /v0/2/g2l?y=2025&m=8&d=11&z=7&lang=zh
```

This should send:

```json
{
  "date": {
    "year": 2025,
    "month": 6,
    "monthSize": 29,
    "leap": true,
    "day": 18
  },
  "text": "乙巳年閏六月（小）十八日"
}
```

which means August 11th, 2025 is the day 18, month 6 (leap) in Lunar calendar (approximately in AD 2025).

**Example 3:** To convert the Gregorian date December 31st, 2010 in time zone +07:00 to Lunar calendar and also get the textual representation in Vietnamese:

```http
GET /v0/2/g2l?y=2010&m=12&d=31&z=7&lang=vi
```

This should send:

```json
{
  "date": {
    "year": 2010,
    "month": 11,
    "monthSize": 29,
    "leap": false,
    "day": 26
  },
  "text": "ngày 26 tháng 11 (nhỏ) năm Canh Dần"
}
```

which means December 31st, 2010 is the day 29, month 11 in Lunar calendar (approximately in AD 2010).

**Example 4:** To convert the Gregorian date August 31st, 2025 in time zone +08:00 to Lunar calendar and also get the textual representation in Simplified Chinese:

```http
GET /v0/2/g2l?y=2025&m=8&d=31&z=8&lang=zh-cn
```

This should send:

```json
{
  "date": {
    "year": 2025,
    "month": 7,
    "monthSize": 30,
    "leap": false,
    "day": 9
  },
  "text": "乙巳年七月（大）初九日"
}
```

which means August 31st, 2025 is the day 9, month 7 (not leap) in Lunar calendar (approximately in AD 2025).

### Convert Lunar date to Gregorian calendar

```http
GET /v0/2/l2g
```

Parameters:

* `y`: The approximate Gregorian year of the Lunar year (which means most of the Lunar year falls in this Gregorian year).
* `m`: Lunar month, from 1 to 12.
* `leap`: Whether the Lunar month is leap. Must be one of: `true` (`1`) or `false` (`0`).
* `d`: Lunar day of month, from 1 to 30.
* `z`: Time zone offset in hours. For example +09:00 is 9, -10:00 is -10, 00:00 is 0.

Return: JSON object of the equivalent date in Gregorian calendar.

**Example:** To convert the Lunar date: day 15, month 8 (not leap), approximately in AD 2024, in time zone +07:00, to Gregorian calendar,

```http
GET /v0/2/l2g?y=2024&m=8&leap=false&d=15&z=7
```

This should send:

```json
{
  "date": {
    "year": 2024,
    "month": 9,
    "day": 17
  }
}
```

which means the Lunar date falls in September 17th, 2024 (Gregorian calendar).
